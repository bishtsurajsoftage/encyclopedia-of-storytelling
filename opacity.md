When an object's opacity = 0 it is fully transparent, or invisible. When it's opacity = 1, it is fully visible.
In [this section](https://genocide.greatarmenia.org/massacre/) of a larger piece [chronicling the history](https://genocide.greatarmenia.org/) leading up the systematic genocidal killings targeting Armenians in the late Ottoman Empire, [opacity] is used on a series of photos showing graphic, pain-stricken bodies. Appearing  in quick succession, with a timed transition that renders the photos appearing slowly, ephemerally, almost ghost-like - the use of [opacity] has the effect of lessening the impact of disturbing images. Although more such images appear later in the piece, this technique also serves as a sort of disclaimer, alerting the reader that more graphic images are to come.
