'Scrollytelling' is a trendy portmanteau describing not a single technique, but a range of techniques to make storytelling interactive while a user scrolls through an interface, which is one of the main ways of navigating on the web.

Some techniques in the range of scrollytelling may include:
- Moving images into view 
- Playing a video automatically when arriving at a point in the story
- Animating elements in view
- Asserting more aggressive control over how the browser behaves with typical user behavior, like scrolling or clicking/tapping

Technically speaking: You want to use techniques like scrolljacking, scroll snapping, timed animations… 
Tools include: GSAP, Scrollify……
