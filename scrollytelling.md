'Scrollytelling' is a trendy portmanteau describing not a single technique, but a range of techniques to make storytelling interactive while a user scrolls through an interface, which is one of the main ways of navigating on the web.

Some techniques in the range of scrollytelling may include:
- Moving images into view 
- Playing a video automatically when arriving at a point in the story
- Animating elements in view
