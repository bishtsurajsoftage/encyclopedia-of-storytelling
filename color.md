Color can show similarity or difference, harmony or dissonance. 
The goal of using color should always be to make use of its visual cues to guide a reader toward a simpler, more straightforward reading of the information presented. 
Color can be vibrant and beautiful just for its own sake â€“ but getting carried away and having a little too much fun with a color palette can overcomplicate the message. 
A wide array of colors may be visually pleasing, but when a reader starts to infer correlations that aren't actually there, they will start to ask themselves, _'wait, what is that color supposed to represent?'_
Choosing a color palette for a data story or data visualization should help viewers absorb the the message at a glance.
