Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli viewed through a device such as a stereoscopic headset, "smart glasses," or a smartphone camera and screen.

Games such as [Pokémon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go) and [Ingress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(video_game)) utilize an [Image Linked Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_Linked_Map&action=edit&redlink=1)(ILM)interface, where approved [geotagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagged)locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with.
