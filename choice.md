Choice is critical. As humans, we want to be able to choose.

Choice in storytelling can be as complex as in Black Mirror's _[Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch)_ - or as simple as offering a reader an option to click view a piece of information - or not.

Ask: Do you want to know the answer to this question? - and you've enticed them, involved them - not just throw information at them.
