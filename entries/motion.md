Motion captures attention by expressing kinetic energy.

It can be used in visual design design to express a change of state or a progression of something - perhaps in a data visualization, or to call attention to certain elements in the design.

Motion needs to be [motivated] by something. In cinematography, camera movements are often described as being motivated or unmotivated by something happening in the frame - a character's movements, actions, or maybe even their thoughts.

Motion can very easily be overused. Especially in journalism, things need to stay still for people to absorb them, especially wordsâ€¦ 

So how should motion be used most effectively?

> There are moments in the films of French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, father of what came to be known as the French New Wave in cinema, where the camera moves in an unmotivated way, almost like a distracted viewer who wants to get away and focus on a window or something. This de-emphasizes the subjects, and serves as a meta-commentary on cinema: implying on the relative unimportance of the things we point our cameras, and therefore attention at. 

> Can we imagine examples where this has been or could be applied in journalism?
