Most data visualization practitioners would recommend avoiding pie charts completely because they are frequently misused and can so easily misrepresent the data. Their popularity is high, but their usability is low. Pie charts are used to depict a part of a whole, creating the common misconception that all percentages can be accurately represented by a pie chart. But a percentage meant to show an increase or decrease from an original number, common in financial reporting, can't be accurately represented by a pie chart because pie charts do not show change over time and are usually not appropriate for making comparisons.
