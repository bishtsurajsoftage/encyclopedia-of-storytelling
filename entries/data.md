Journalists working with data can think about three key stages: collecting, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Collecting data

```
You can find data online, 
Data can be stored & worked with in many different formats, from simple to complexâ€¦
```

### Interpreting data

```
Then you analyze (and probably spend a lot of time cleaning) the data until they are squeaky clean and reveal their wonderous insights to you.
```

### Presenting data

```
Make a beautiful, or not beautiful, presentation of the data. Beauty is nice, and it presents itself sometimes, but it's not the point.
