It's actually the origin of the term 'recap'.
Though best described in modern terms as "the part where you start wrapping it up"-  the recapitulation is one of the defining characteristics of the sonata form in Western classical music.
_Fun fact:_ Scholars of Beethoven have studied his Fifth Symphony and [pointed out](https://www.cmuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fifth-symphony-golden-ratio.jpg) that the recapitulation starts wrapping up exactly 61.8% of the way through ~ which is the Golden Ratio!
