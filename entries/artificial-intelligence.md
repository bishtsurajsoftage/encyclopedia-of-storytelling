Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly difficult thanks to its entering the popular psyche through sci-fi movies. Broadly speaking, AI techniques do things that once required human decision-making capability, and can be grouped into a few subcategories:


- Automation
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networds
