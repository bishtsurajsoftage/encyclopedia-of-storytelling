The Ancient Greek term mīmēsis (μίμησις) derives from mīmeisthai (μιμεῖσθαι, 'to imitate'). In ancient Greece, mīmēsis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and the good. 
In storytelling, mimicry can be used to draw on what is familiar to an audience in order to elicit an emotion. Or, it can be used as a design technique.
