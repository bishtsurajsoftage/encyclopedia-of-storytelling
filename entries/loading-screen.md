We're all familiar with these, but  behind the scenes is basically an illusion...
Any magician knows that the key to a good trick is distraction.
When you visit a website, the magic of transporting all the assets - images, video, JavaScript interactivity - take time to load. 
A loading animation can be used to basically cause a diversion to sustain the audience's attention long enough while the real work gets done.
It may reflect the measure of the acutal progress of the assets loading, or it may not.
