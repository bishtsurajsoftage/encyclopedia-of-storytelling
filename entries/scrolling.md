Scrolling is how we are used to navigating websites, on screens large and small. 
When combined with [CSS] techniques such as [sticky positioning](position-sticky), the relationship between scrolling (and perhaps non-scrolling) elements can convey a sense of parallel or concurrent actions or paths.
### horizontal scrolling 
Users are  accustomed to web pages scrolling top to bottom. Scrolling vertically down a page is generally understood to be the default. However, it can be exchanged for a horizontal scroll, to defy the user's [expectations].
