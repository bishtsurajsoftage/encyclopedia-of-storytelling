Photogrammetry is the art and science of turning two-dimensional images into 3D by tracing the overlap in photographs (or video frames)  and converting them into a 3D digital models of an object or space.
Photogrammetry is often used by surveyors, architects, engineers, and contractors to create topographical maps, meshes, point clouds, or drawings to recreate simulated 3D representations of the real world.
