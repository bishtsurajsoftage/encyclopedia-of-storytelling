# The Encyclopedia of Storytelling


## annotations
[technique]
Like the notes and doodles in the margin of a high school textbook left by its previous owner, annotations draw your attention to the most important information. Often used to highlight the key figures in a document, annotations reveal [the artists hand] and give the reader access to the thinking behind the creation, for example to demonstrate an expert saving you the time of sifting though countless documents to point out primary source of a data point - while still respecting you to show you the source, if you'd like to have a look yourself. The result is that you feel cared for, guided through a curated experience.
[Nieman](https://niemanstoryboard.org/storyboard-category/annotation-tuesday/) uses them as a little chat bubble that the user can click on to view something… a meta-conversation outside the main content

## audio forensic analysis
[technique]
A technique to visually represent sound on a timeline – especially useful for mapping gunshots.
Audio forensics is the field of forensic science relating **to the acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of sound recordings**. The field of audio forensics was largely established in 1973 during the Watergate scandal.

* [The Killing Of Tahir Elçi](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-killing-of-tahir-elci)


## artist's hand
"The artist's hand" refers to the evidence of authorship in a work, identified by the creator's unique personal left in the final product. It may be hidden, or it may be carefully deployed at certain moments to achieve maximum affect.

## augmented reality (AR)
Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli viewed through a device such as a stereoscopic headset, "smart glasses," or a smartphone camera and screen.
_Games such as[Pokémon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go) and[Ingress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(video_game)) utilize an[Image Linked Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image_Linked_Map&action=edit&redlink=1)(ILM) interface, where approved[geotagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagged) locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with._
### Examples

## cartography
[tool]
The art and science of making maps. Today, it's done digitally, and we can represent amazing things about human geography.


## chatbot
[tool]
A story form that gives the reader the feeling of familiarity. Their purpose is to engage users by replicating human conversation - sometimes to [eerie effect](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/jessica-simulation-artificial-intelligence/).


## chiaroscuro
[concept]
From the Italian for “bright–dark.” High contrast, evoking a sense of heightened intensity or drama. Black and white
For example: The high-contrast polarity of a chessboard can create a sense of order, but also restriction: a limited set of possible moves, entrapment.


## choice
[concept]
Choice is critical. As humans, we want to be able to choose.
Choice in storytelling can be as complex as in Black Mirror's _[Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch)_ - or as simple as offering a reader an option to click view a piece of information - or not.
Ask: Do you want to know the answer to this question? - and you've enticed them, involved them - not just throw information at them.


## color
#### [visual vocabulary]
_Color shows harmony. The goal should always be to use color to simplify the information, but it's easy to have a little too much fun with the color palette and overcomplicate the message. A rainbow palette is visually interesting, but usually makes the data more difficult to understand. Instead, choose a palette that helps viewers read your visualization at a glance—and always use darker or more vivid colors as the fill color. A solid foundation to use when getting started is to start with some widely accepted basic color schemes: _
  * _Complementary Colors: opposite one another on the color wheel. _
  * _Split Complementary: One color and the two colors on either side of its complementary color wheel. _
  * _Triad: Three colors from equidistant points on the color wheel._


## color scale
[data]
* categorical-qualitative
* sequential-linear
* divergent


## connection
[concept]
The importance cannot be overstated. Our brains use both figurative and literal connections to associate information. We want our readers to _make connections,_ so we have to do so as well.
Connection can be _visual_ (see how just [drawing a line](https://data.world/) between sections can make it easier to follow a path of a narrative?) or _thematic_, or symbolic — or a mix of any of them.


## completion bar / path completion
[component]
Shows the user a milestone of how far along they are.
Effective at motivating the user, especially if you are asking them to do something. This creates a feeling of respecting their time, a visual reward for sticking through to the finish.
* Example[on the web](http://preview.themeforest.net/item/sapphire-one-multipurpose-bootstrap-html5/full_screen_preview/15679180)


## composition


## composite image

### Examples
- [The New York Times: Bird’s Eye View of Protests Across the U.S. and Around the World](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protest-aerial-photos.html)
see also: [photogrammetry]

## crescendo
[concept]
Italian for _“growing,”_ crescendo is a term that comes from music to denote a gradual but decisive increase in volume or intensity.* Bolero


## data
Journalists working with data can think about three key stages: collecting, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Collecting data

```
You can find data online, 
Data can be stored & worked with in many different formats, from simple to complex…
```

### Interpreting data

```
Then you analyze (and probably spend a lot of time cleaning) the data until they are squeaky clean and reveal their wonderous insights to you.
```

### Presenting data

```
Make a beautiful, or not beautiful, presentation of the data. Beauty is nice, and it presents itself sometimes, but it's not the point.
```

## data point


## data visualization
[technique]
Storytelling by presenting data visually. This can be anything from…


## diptych
[art]
Two things side by side.
### Examples
* [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html)


## distribution
[math]
In [data] visualization and especially [charts] and graphs, distribution is………


## feedback
[concept]
It takes two to be _inter_-active – feedback is the part that the page gives back to you. Think when you scroll down and the laptop opens, à la [Apple.com](http://apple.com/)


## embed
[web]
Placing a small piece of code onto a page that pulls in content linked from another website. For example a chart, a tweet, a form…


## expectation
[concept]
Expectations, when they're met, imply regularity and inspire calm. Betray them, and it can generate a sense of excitement, or also anxiety. That can be what you want, but even when trying to be avant garde, always remember basic expectations - that something will function basically.


## explanatory journalism
...Vox


## factbox 
[element]

Reusable background facts about a figure or issue mentioned in the reportage. Helps readers get filled in about context that they might not be up to speed on.* Examples
* The Guardian uses them often
* and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/business/media/a-g-sulzberger-new-york-times-publisher.html#link-54b0c850)
* …So does [Reuters](https://news.trust.org/item/20211004030118-u5rh3)
* [https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites)

## fade-in
[technique] [design vocabulary]

A fade-in creates a sense of the ephemeral – it serves to underscore an element's existence – not just that when you come to it while scrolling on a page.

A fade-in is (usually) achieved by changing the element's [opacity] over a short transition period._ A quick transition means …, a slower transition can mean…_

_see also: [opacity]

## field of view
[concept]
In cinematography, the eye of the camera tells the viewer where our vantage point is.
On the web, this can be attained with photographic or video elements, or even the viewport.
see also: [perspective]


## fixed position
<!-- ¿See also [position:fixed]  -->
When an object on a web document is "fixed" to the [viewport]
Not to be confused with [sticky] - where an object is fixed for a certain period while [scrolling]
<!-- >
How to combine entries for [fixed position] and [sticky position] ??? 
  Maybe use a single [position] entry? Or put them under scrolling? // Also keep these entires as reference links?
-->


## frame scrubbing
A technique that moves through frames tied to the user's scroll position on the page.
### Examples
* [New York Times: Beirut](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/09/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion.html)


## geolocation
[technique]
The science of looking at photos and determining where on the map they were taken.


## form
Everyone knows what a form is. We fill them out in order to give to someone who is collecting data. So what happens with that data?
On the web, a form is made up of HTML [input] elements, and a magic Submit button that takes all the data from the inputs and fires it off somewhere on the internet. Presto! Now you have [data].
### Examples:
* [reader submissions]


## Geospatial Information Systems (GIS)
Geo, from the Greek _“ gē ”_ for  ‘earth'. Spatial, from the Latin _“ spatium ”_ for ‘space'.
In other words, maps with data.*


### Examples
* [Mapping data and visualizing geospatial information: A quick introduction for journalists](https://journalistsresource.org/home/mapping-data-visualization-geospatial-information-journalism/)

graphs & charts

descriptions from Github [Apache] and Wikipedia [Creative Commons]

Alluvial Diagram
It shows correlations between categorical dimensions representing them as flows, visually linking categories with shared items. Each rectangle represents a unique value in the selected dimension, its height is proportional to its value. Correlations are represented with curved lines whose width is proportional to their value.
Useful for showing: Correlations, proportions
Arc Diagram
An arc diagram is particular kind of network graph showing relationships among nodes. Nodes are displayed on the horizontal axis, and links as clockwise arcs. An arc above the nodes means a connection from the left to the right, while below means a connection from the right node to the left one.
Useful for showing: Networks
bar graph
The best use for a bar graph is to display trends grouped by categories or time. One axis shows an amount while the other is used to label each bar. It's best not to use a bar graph to compare items that require different scales (see the chapter on Scale.) If you need to show percentages that add up to a whole, try a 1OO% bar graph. They are always the same length, and divided by color.
Grouped:
Stacked:
Useful for showing: correlation
Beeswarm plot
It displays the distribution of items over a continuous dimensions. Each (line) is represented with a dot placed on the horizontal axis. The vertical dimension is used to avoid overlaps among circles, showing their distribution. The area of dots can be used to encode a further quantitative dimension and a quantitative or categorical dimension with color.
Useful for showing: distributions, time series, proportions
Box plot
It summarizes a quantitative distribution with five standard statistics: the smallest value, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and largest value.
Useful for showing: distribution
Bubble chart
The basic layout is a scatter plot, which allows to see correlations among two continuous dimensions. A further quantitative dimension with size and a quantitative or categorical dimension with color.
Useful for showing: correlation, proportion
Bumpchart
It allows the comparison of multiple categories over a continuous dimension and the evolution of its sorting. By default, sorting is based on the stream size.
Useful for showing: time series, correlation, proportion
Circle Packing
It displays values of leaf nodes of a hierarchical structure by using circles areas. The hierarchical structure is depicted using nested circles. A further quantitative dimension with size and a quantitative or categorical dimension with color.
Useful for showing: hierarchy, proportion
Dendrogram
Circular: It displays hierarchically structured data with a radial tree structure, where the root node is in the center with the hierarchies moving outward. The area of nodes can be used to encode a further quantitative dimension and a quantitative or categorical dimension with color.
Linear: It displays hierarchically structured data with a tree structure, where the root node is on the left and leaves are on the right. The size of nodes can be used to encode a further quantitative dimension with size and a quantitative or categorical dimension with color.
Useful for showing: hierarchy, proportion
Contour plot
It shows the estimated density of point clouds, which is especially useful to avoid overplotting in large datasets.
Useful for showing: correlation, distribution
Convex hull
In mathematics, the convex hull is the smallest convex shape containing a set of points. Applied to a scatterplot, it is useful to identify points belonging to the same category.
Useful for showing: correlation, proportion
Gantt chart
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, developed by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.
Useful for showing: progress over time
Hexagonal binning
Hexagonal Binning is a way to manage the problem of having too many points that start to overlap. Hexagonal binning plots density, rather than points. Points are binned into gridded hexagons and distribution (the number of points per hexagon) is displayed using either the color or the area of the hexagons.
Useful for showing: correlation, distribution
Horizon graph
It displays a quantitative dimension over a continuous interval or time period. Horizon graphs combine position and color to reduce vertical space.
Useful for showing: time series, distribution
line graph
Line graphs are great for displaying trends over time and across categories. The advantage of a line graph over a bar graph is that it shows trend lines which make understanding change over time easier. Plus, you can show multiple lines to see how trends compare. It's best to reserve the line graph for visualizations showing trends and change over time, otherwise they can begin to complicate the message.
Line graphs can have a single or multiple line, showing multiple….
Useful for showing: time series, correlation
Matrix Plot
It allows comparison of two categorical dimensions, disposing them on the horizontal and vertical axes. Each glyph (square or circle) represents a possible correlation among the two dimensions. Associated quantitative variables can be represented with size and/or color.
Useful for showing: correlation of…...
Parallel coordinates
It displays multiple continuous dimensions as axes, and each row in the dataset produces a line connecting its values across the axes.
Useful for showing:
Radar Chart
It displays multiple continuous dimensions as axes starting from the same point and by disposing them radially. Each dimension is represented as an axis starting from the center of the cart. The same scale is applied to all the axes.
Useful for showing: correlation…
Sankey Diagram
Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram emphasize the major transfers or flows within a system, in which the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate. The diagrams are often used in the visualization of material flow analysis.They help locate the most important contributions to a flow. They often show conserved quantities within defined system boundaries.
It represents flows among nodes of a network. Nodes are represented as rectangles, the height represents their value. Flows are represented with curved lines whose width is proportional to their value.
Useful for showing: networks…
Streamgraph (area chart)
It allows the comparison of multiple categories over a continuous dimension.
Useful for showing: time series, (changing) proportions…
Sunburst diagram
It displays hierarchically structured data and a related quantitative dimension using concentric circles. The circle in the center represents the root node, with the hierarchies moving outward from the center. The angle of each arc corresponds to the qualitative dimension.
Useful for showing: hierarchy, proportion
Treemap
It displays hierarchically structured data and a related quantitative dimension. It is composed of an area divided into small rectangles, representing the last level of the tree structure. The rectangles' size depends on the quantitative dimension.
Useful for showing: hierarchy, proportion
Violin plot
It is useful to show the distribution of a numeric dimension. The shape width represents the amount of items with the same value in the dataset.
Useful for showing: distribution, frequency……
Voronoi Diagram
It creates the minimum area around each point defined by two variables. When applied to a scatterplot, it is useful to show the distance between points.
Useful for showing: dispersion
data needed: at least # data points for each…

## juxtaposition
[design vocabulary]
Implies that two things are equal, concurrent
See also: [diptych]


## melody
The melody is the main voice of a piece of music, as opposed to the harmony.
Melody guides the center of the narrative. It can be thought of as the "main character" in a story, where the harmony serves as supporting characters. Of course, the melody can be a [duet] without changing its character too much.

## montage
[visual vocabulary]
A term originating from cinema… shows concurrent action, and the passage of time.
On the web, this can be a **slideshow,** or....


## motion
[design/visual]
Motion captures attention, and can represent energy,.
Motion needs to be [motivated] by something. In cinematography, camera movements are often described as being motivated or unmotivated by something happening in the frame - a character's movements, actions, or maybe even their thoughts.

```
There are moments in the films of French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, father of what came to be known as the French New Wave in cinema, where the camera moves in an unmotivated way, almost like a distracted viewer who wants to get away and focus on a window or something. This de-emphasizes the subjects, and serves as a meta-commentary on cinema: implying on the relative unimportance of the things we point our cameras, and therefore attention at – I'm not creative enough to think of a way that might be applicable to journalism - but if you want to be the Godard of journalism, say go for it! Send me a postcard from ;;
```

Motion can very easily be overused. Especially in journalism, things need to stay still for people to absorb them, especially words… So how it be used effectively?

## one at a time **(regularity?)
[]
A type of [rhythm] that uses silence and space between, and removes complexity in order to place attention on the message being delivered.**This could also be called *regularity* or consistency, or monotony, or Bolero.


## opacity
* In [this section](https://genocide.greatarmenia.org/massacre/) of a larger piece [chronicling the history](https://genocide.greatarmenia.org/) leading up the systematic genocidal killings targeting Armenians in the late Ottoman Empire, [opacity] is used on a series of photos showing graphic, pain-stricken bodies. Appearing  in quick succession, with a timed transition that renders the photos appearing slowly, ephemerally, almost ghost-like - the use of [opacity] has the effect of lessening the impact of disturbing images. Although more such images appear later in the piece, this technique also serves as a sort of disclaimer, alerting the reader that more graphic images are to come.


## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
[tool/technique]
PDF documents, especially if they were created from scans of paper docuents, may not have the text converted into machine-readable text characters, which would allow you copy & paste it, or extract the data in order to do any further analysis. In that case, you will need to run it through a program that can perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

These include:
- Abode Acrobat (licensed)
- (Open Source) [GUI](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty.html) or Command Line

See more about [working with scanned documents…]()

## opensource
[]
A field and a movement, it]s the idea that anyone can look inside the code. It ensures transparency, that an app does what it says it does. It allows people to learn from, even copy and build upon a set of code.* 
 There are communities like [#opengov]...

## parallax
Parallax is an optical illusion that occurs because objects closer to the viewer appear to move faster than objects that are further away.
Picture yourself on a moving train watching the trees go by. The trees close to the track appear to whiz by, while the trees further away appear to slowly crawl by in the distance.

## photogrammetry
[technique]
Photogrammetry is the art and science of turning two-dimensional images into 3D by tracing the overlap in photographs (or video frames)  and converting them into a 3D digital models of an object or space.
Photogrammetry is often used by surveyors, architects, engineers, and contractors to create topographical maps, meshes, point clouds, or drawings to recreate simulated 3D representations of the real world.




## pie chart
[dataviz]
_ dataviz_
* _ most data visualization experts would recommend avoiding pie charts completely because they are frequently misused and can so easily misrepresent the data. Their popularity is high, but their usability is low. Pie charts are used to depict a part of a whole, creating the common misconception that all percentages can be accurately represented by a pie chart. But a percentage meant to show an increase or decrease from an original number, common in financial reporting, can't be accurately represented by a pie chart because pie charts do not show change over time and are usually not appropriate for making comparisons._

## reader submissions
This "community engagement" strategy is old as newspapers themselves. Whether Letters To The Editor, Dear Abby, or user-generated stories... It's a great way to let your audience see themselves.
_Technology Needed:_ * A [form] on your website to receive submissions
* Either a service, or a server to receive the form entry data
### Examples:
* The New York Times[Tiny Love Stories](https://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love) ([Submissions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/style/modern-love-tiny-love-stories.html))

## rhythm
[  ]
Whether music or space between elements on a page...
The components of rhythm are regularity and spacing...
Remember that rhythm is the product of the relationship between sound and the absence of sound.
(Or that could be photos and not-photos. Do not overuse.)


## recapitulation
[concept]
Though best described in modern terms as "the part where you begin wrapping it up"-  the recapitulation is one of the defining characteristics of the sonata form in Western classical music.* Read more from [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/art/sonata-form/Development#ref1180277)

## reveal/revelation
The element of surprise: the curtain going up. The camera comes around a corner. Reveal is all about how you unveil something that was hidden.


## scale
[visual vocabulary]
Without scale, you don't know where you are. You can't have the zoom-in.
This is so important when it comes to photography and cropping. It's not just about absolute size, but the size relative to how much space there is in the room of the viewer's mind. Can you feel big in a desert?
- Example: Note in [this New York Times Magazine cover](https://newspagedesigner.org/blogs/the-value-of-great-photo-editing-and-the-strength-of-tiny-type) how the use of cropping creates a sense of scale that aligns with the content of the story - emphasizing the grandeur of this dying rhinoceros and the small text evoking powerlessness in face of its tragic, yet imminent extinction.
- The importance of understanding scale is both the methodology and the theme of this piece by Reuters Graphics looking at the [Rohingya exodus](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010050XD232/index.html).


## scrolling
[web / interactivity]
Scrolling is how we are used to navigating websites, on screens large and small. 
* For example: conveying a sense of parallel or concurrent actions or paths.
### horizontal scrolling 
Yes, we're used to web pages scrolling top to bottom. Scrolling vertically down a page is generally understood to be the default. However, it can be exchanged for a horizontal scroll, to defy the user's [expectations]. 
* [Horizontal Scrolling in Web Design: How to Do It Well](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/horizontal-scrolling)_See also: motion_
### scroll snapping
This can be used to more neatly guide the experience onto certain points, giving the feeling of "slides."

## sforzando
[concept]
Musical term, from Italian meaning “ “. A loud sound suddenly coming to a chokingly abrupt stop.
It's like the audio version of a “cliffhanger” - which is a story form in itself.
Editors oftem employ this technique when they abruptly pause followign the narrative strands of a text story - which focus on the characters and what's happening with them - and switch to
Even though this may sort of drop the bottom out from a story that reader was engaging with, it serves to hold their attention and use the suspense of wanting to know what happens next, and utilize that to give them a boost of energy to get through a section of contextual factoids that may be a bit dry, yet necessary to delivering the larger goal of connecting this individual's story to a larger trend, or perhaps the nutgraph.
